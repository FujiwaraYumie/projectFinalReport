These days，penetration of mobile phone in Japan is over a hundred percent. Especially，penetration of smart phone in Japan is over half hundred percent. All of the Japanese people have a mobile phone and half of Japanese people have a smart phone. So we are not able to live without the smartphone.
Why smart phones are spreading? This is because convenience of smart phones. We can do various things such as playing a game，watching a movie，web browsing，doing schedule management doing data management using SNS application，seeing the map，chat，and so on at using smart phones. Until today，we had things we cannot do without PC but now，we can do it at small mobile device. Wherever we are. 
Therefore we do suggestion of the application，development by three combinations，FUTURE UNIVERSITY HAKODATE，KANAGAWA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY，NAGASAKI UNIVERSITY by this project. We suggestion of development futuristic application which it was not so far. 
We develop applications using development process of waterfall. First，we suggest application’s ideas. Second，we write development documentation. Third，we develop applications. Last，we do the test for application. Moreover，we consider business model because we want to suggest application which many people use. 
We can learn the development process when we use this development process. This is the project purpose.
